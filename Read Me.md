Project Overview
AtniQ, a hardware company, experienced a notable decline in revenue, prompting the management to seek a detailed analysis of sales data to uncover underlying issues and formulate strategies for improvement. I was tasked with performing a comprehensive descriptive analysis of the sales data, leveraging SQL and Power BI to gain insights and visualize key metrics.

Data Analysis Approach
1. ETL Processes and Data Cleaning
The initial phase of the project involved extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data from various sources into a centralized database. This included:

Extracting raw sales data from multiple systems.
Transforming the data to ensure consistency, accuracy, and completeness.
Loading the cleaned and standardized data into a SQL database for further analysis.
2. SQL Analysis
Using SQL, I developed complex queries to analyze the sales data. This involved:

Aggregating sales data by regions, time periods, customer segments, and product categories.
Identifying trends and patterns in revenue generation.
Analyzing the impact of different sales channels on overall revenue.
3. Power BI Dashboard Development
To visualize the results of the analysis, I created an interactive Power BI dashboard. The dashboard highlighted key metrics and allowed the management to drill down into specific areas of interest. The key components of the dashboard included:

Revenue Trends: A time-series analysis of revenue to identify high-performing and low-performing periods.
Market Share: Visual representation of AtniQ's market share across different regions.
Customer Demographics: Breakdown of revenue by customer type, sales channels, and geographic locations.
Product Performance: Analysis of revenue contributions from different product categories and brands.
Key Insights
Regional Performance
Top Regions: The analysis identified Delhi, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Nagpur, and Bhopal as the top five regions in terms of revenue generation.
Yearly Performance: January 2018 was highlighted as the top-performing year, while the period post-2020 showed a significant decline in revenue.
Customer Analysis
Sales Channels: 60% of the revenue was generated through offline sales, while 30% came from online sales.
Regional Sales Channels:
Delhi, Ahmedabad, and Bhopal generated 90% of their revenue through offline channels.
Mumbai and Bhopal had 50% of their revenue from offline channels, while Nagpur had 30%.
Key Customers: Stores such as Electricalsara Stores, Excl Stores, and Info Stores were identified as 100% offline revenue contributors.
Product Performance
Revenue Trends: The revenue decline was less pronounced in the distribution sector over a five-year period.
Brand Performance: 80% of the revenue was derived from AtniQ's own brand products.
Strategic Recommendations
Based on the insights gathered from the analysis, several strategic recommendations were proposed to the management:

Focus on High-Performing Regions: Prioritize sales and marketing efforts in Delhi, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Nagpur, and Bhopal to leverage their high revenue potential.
Enhance Offline Sales: Given the significant contribution of offline sales, especially in key regions, investing in offline marketing strategies and strengthening relationships with key customers could be beneficial.
Targeted Promotions for Online Sales: Develop targeted promotions and campaigns to boost online sales, especially in regions where online revenue is relatively lower.
Brand Promotion: Continue to promote AtniQ's own brand products, which constitute the majority of the revenue, while exploring opportunities to expand the product line.
Conclusion
The descriptive analysis provided a clear understanding of the factors contributing to AtniQ's revenue decline and offered actionable insights to help the management develop effective strategies for revenue improvement. The interactive Power BI dashboard served as a valuable tool for ongoing monitoring and decision-making.
